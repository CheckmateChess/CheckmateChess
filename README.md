<h1>Web chess application based on GNUChess</h1>

- We ( [Ozge](https://github.com/default-usr) and [Esref](https://github.com/esrefozturk)  ) developed this project during the 2014-2015 Fall Semester as project of [Software Development with Scripting Languges](http://www.ceng.metu.edu.tr/course/ceng498/) course.
- We used Pair Programming as software development technique.
- It works best with GNU Chess 6.1.2
